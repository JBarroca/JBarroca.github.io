<img class="content_image_left" src="/assets/images/jag_zoom.jpeg" alt="a picture of myself"> Hi! My name is Jos√© Barroca. I was born in 1982 in Lisbon, Portugal. I became a medical doctor in 2008 and a specialist in Internal Medicine in 2015, with a special interest in cardiovascular medicine, heart failure and diabetes.

In the beginning of 2016, my wife and I felt the need to find a better balance between work and family life. Therefore, we moved to Sweden to continue to work as doctors.

After a lot of soulsearching, I decided I needed to change my career path in order to pursue other lifelong interests. I've always been fascinated with computer science, programming and being creative with software. I've therefore started a degree in Software Development and Operations and a Master's Degree in eHealth, both taught remotely by [Linnaeus University](https://lnu.se/en/ "LNU homepage").

I also play the guitar and drums, although not nearly as well. I enjoy experimenting with home recording via the computer and using virtual instruments and effects as a creative outlet.

I also love sketching and painting with watercolors, particularly outside, and am an avid collector of books on urban sketching and artists' sketchbooks. I've also been trying to follow my swedish neighbours' example and have worked out regularly at the gym this past year. 

However, my favourite spare time activity these past months has been playing with our 8-month old son.
